# Resume

This repository contains my resume in Markdown format (`resume.md`) and uses GitHub Actions to generate PDF and DOCX versions based on a configuration file (`resume.yml`).

## Features
1. Markdown resume stored as `resume.md`.
2. Configuration in `resume.yml` for styling and output filenames.
3. GitHub Actions workflow to generate `resume.pdf` and `resume.docx`.
4. Auto-triggers on changes to `resume.md` or `resume.yml`, or can be run manually.

## How to Use
1. Edit `resume.md` or `resume.yml` as needed.
2. Push changes to the repository or trigger the workflow manually via the "Actions" tab.
3. Download the generated `resume.pdf` and `resume.docx` from the workflow artifacts.

## Requirements
- GitHub Actions enabled.
- No local setup required; everything runs in the cloud.
